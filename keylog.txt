GPT:Write a poem on python programing.
In the world of code and computing,

A language stands above the rest,

Python, with its power and ease,

Is a language that's truly blessed.

From its syntax to its features,

Python proves its worth each day,

Making complex tasks seem simple,

In its very own unique way.

It's a language that's versatile,

Used in many different fields,

From web development to data science,

Python is what each programmer wields.

With its libraries and functions,

Python makes coding a breeze,

And with its endless possibilities,

Our imagination it does seize.
So let us raise a toast to Python,

And to all the programmers who use it well,

For with this language, and their skills,
The world they surely do propel.
