PDear [Friend],

I hope this letter finds you well. I recently heard about your situation and wanted to share something that I think may help pass the time while you recover. During the last ten years, anime has become increasingly popular and I believe it could be a great source of entertainment for you.

If you're not familiar, anime is a form of Japanese animation that covers a wide range of genres and subject matter. There are so many great shows and movies out there that I'm sure you'll be able to find something that interests you. 

Here are a few recommendations to get you started:

1. Attack on Titan - an action-packed series about humanityâ€™s fight against giant humanoid creatures called Titans.
2. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - a classic adventure that follows the Elric brothers in their quest to regain their bodies after a failed alchemy experiment.
3. Your Lie in April - a beautiful and emotional story about a young pianist who meets a violinist who changes his life.
4. Sword Art Online - a series about players trapped in a virtual reality game where they must fight to survive.

These are just a few examples of the amazing anime series that have come out in the past decade. I truly believe that anime could be a great way to keep your mind engaged while you recover, and I hope you give it a chance. 

Take care, 
[Your name]
